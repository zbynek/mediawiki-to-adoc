# Mediawiki To AsciiDoc

Grabs content from MediaWiki through API and converts it to [AsciiDoc](https://asciidoc.org/)
using [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).

Some assumptions in the code may only apply to GeoGebra Wiki.

## Similar projects
These are also wrappers around pandoc, but are using WikiText directly. 
That comes with some problems (mostly related to expanding templates)
